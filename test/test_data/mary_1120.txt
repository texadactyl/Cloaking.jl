Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
It's fleece was white as snow
Everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
It followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
It followed her to school one day
Which was againts the rules
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see the lamb at school
And so the teacher turned it out
Turned it out, turned it out
And so the teacher turned it out
But still it lingered near
Why does the lamb love Mary so?
Love Mary so, love Mary so
Why does the lamb love Mary so?
The eager children cry
Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know
The lamb, you know, the lamb, you know
Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know
The teacher did reply
Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
It's fleece was white as snow
Everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
It's fleece was white as snow!
